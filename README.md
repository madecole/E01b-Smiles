# E01b-Smiles
An exercise exploring variables and loops using Python Arcade.

This repository contains several files that you will need to alter to complete the assignment. The instructions for the exercise are also on Canvas.

Comments in Python are marked by a # sign (for single-line comments) or three matching quotation marks (''' or """) if a comment requires more than one line. They should also appear in a different color in VS Code. The Python Interpreter ignores comments, so you can safely include any information you want there.

As with your assignments, please edit the LICENSE file (replace the [year] [fullname] with the current year and your name); you will also be expected to edit README.md (this file) to describe what you have accomplished.

This program creates a smiling face that is centered on the canvas. 
Main1.py takes shapes that were previously created and centers them on the screen. X-values, Y-values, width, and height values are adjusted according to how closely the rendered image resembles the example.
Main2.py approaches the same problem as main1.py, but instead of simply replacing values main2.py adds or subtracts values based on the determined dimensional values of the arcade window. The program adds or subtracts values from X and Y in order to center the shapes and make them resemble the example image.
Main3.py is the same program as main2.py, but the shapes are named and grouped together. The same subtraction and addition to X and Y values occurs in this program, centering the shapes and comparing them to the example image.
Main4.py creates the same smiley face, but this program lines the smiley faces up and layers them multiple times across the arcade screen.

*Extra credit:* 

main5.py is much more complicated, but it allows the smiley face to track mouse movements. Add a comment to every line describing what is happening. Save those changes.

If you want to further explore Python Arcade, the API and some sample projects are available at [arcade.academy](http://arcade.academy).
